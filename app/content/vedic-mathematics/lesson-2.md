# Lesson 2: Understanding Bases & Complements

## Objective of This Lesson
This lesson builds the **most important foundation** of Vedic Maths.  
If you clearly understand *bases* and *complements*, then **multiplication, subtraction, squaring, and division** will automatically become easy later.

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what a **base** means
- Learn how to calculate **complements step by step**
- Know **why complements work**
- Be fully prepared for upcoming Vedic Maths techniques

## 1. What is a Base? (Explained for Beginners)

In Vedic Maths, a **base** is simply a **round number** that is easy to work with mentally.

### Common Bases Used
- Base **10** → for small numbers
- Base **100** → for 2‑digit numbers
- Base **1000** → for 3‑digit numbers
- Base **10,000** → for large numbers

### Why Use a Base?
Because our brain finds it **easier to calculate with round numbers** like 10, 100, or 1000.

Instead of calculating the full number, we calculate:
> **How far the number is from the base**

This distance is called the **complement**.

---

## 2. What is a Complement?

### Simple Definition
A **complement** tells us **how much we need to add to a number to reach the base**.

### Formula
Complement = Base − Number

---

## 3. Complements from Base 10 (Very Easy)

### How to Think
Ask yourself:
> “What should I add to this number to make 10?”

### Examples
| Number | Complement | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2 | 8 | 2 + 8 = 10 |
| 5 | 5 | 5 + 5 = 10 |
| 7 | 3 | 7 + 3 = 10 |
| 9 | 1 | 9 + 1 = 10 |

👉 **Tip:** Complements from 10 should be instant and memorized.

---

## 4. Complements from Base 100

### Beginner-Friendly Rule
- Look at the **last two digits**
- Subtract them from **100**

### Examples
| Number | Complement | Explanation |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 34 | 66 | 34 + 66 = 100 |
| 58 | 42 | 58 + 42 = 100 |
| 91 | 9 | 91 + 9 = 100 |
| 99 | 1 | 99 + 1 = 100 |

👉 Do NOT change the number of digits mentally — just think “how much to reach 100”.

---

## 5. Complements from Base 1000

### Simple Rule
- Subtract the **last three digits** from **1000**

### Examples
| Number | Complement |
|------|-----------|
| 998 | 2 |
| 875 | 125 |
| 640 | 360 |
| 999 | 1 |

---

## 6. Universal Complement Trick (Works for Any Base)

This is a **very powerful Vedic Maths trick**.

### Steps
1. Subtract **each digit from 9**, except the last digit
2. Subtract the **last digit from 10**

### Example: Complement of 462 (Base 1000)
- 4 → 9 − 4 = 5
- 6 → 9 − 6 = 3
- 2 → 10 − 2 = 8

✅ Complement = **538**

Check:  
462 + 538 = 1000 ✔

---

## 7. Why Complements Are So Important

Complements help you:
- Do **subtraction without borrowing**
- Multiply by **9, 99, 999**
- Multiply numbers **near 10, 100, 1000**
- Square numbers quickly
- Divide faster using Vedic methods

> Nearly every powerful Vedic Maths shortcut starts with complements.

---

## 8. Simple Daily-Life Example

### Example: 100 − 47
Instead of traditional subtraction:
- Complement of 47 from 100 = **53**
- So, 100 − 47 = **53**

This saves time and avoids mistakes.

---

## 9. Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Using wrong base  
❌ Forgetting number of zeros  
❌ Mixing subtraction and complement  
❌ Overthinking simple numbers  

✅ Always ask: “Which base is closest?”

---

## 10. Practice Section (Do Mentally)

### A. Base 10
1. Complement of 3 = ?
2. Complement of 8 = ?

### B. Base 100
3. Complement of 29 = ?
4. Complement of 64 = ?

### C. Base 1000
5. Complement of 995 = ?
6. Complement of 720 = ?

### Answers
1. 7  
2. 2  
3. 71  
4. 36  
5. 5  
6. 280
