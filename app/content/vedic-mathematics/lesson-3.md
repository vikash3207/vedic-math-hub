# Lesson 3: Fast Addition & Subtraction Using Complements

## Objective of This Lesson
In this lesson, you will learn:
- Why traditional subtraction feels difficult
- How complements remove borrowing
- How to perform fast subtraction mentally
- How complements also simplify addition
- How Vedic Maths reduces calculation errors

This lesson is based directly on **Lesson 2: Bases & Complements**.

## Why Traditional Subtraction Is Difficult

Example:
100 − 47

Using the traditional method, we need borrowing and multiple steps.
This increases confusion and chances of error.

Vedic Maths avoids borrowing entirely.

---

## Core Idea of Vedic Subtraction

Instead of subtracting directly, we calculate:
“How far is the number from the base?”

That distance is the **complement**.

So:
100 − 47 = complement of 47 from 100 = 62

---

## Subtraction Using Base 10

Example:
10 − 6

Complement of 6 from 10 = 4

Answer: 4

---

## Subtraction Using Base 100

Example:
100 − 38

38 + 62 = 100

Answer: 62

Example:
100 − 74

Complement of 74 = 26

Answer: 26

---

## Subtraction Using Base 1000

Example:
1000 − 486

Using complement rule:
- 4 → 9 − 4 = 5
- 8 → 9 − 8 = 1
- 6 → 10 − 6 = 4

Complement = 514

Answer: 514

## Why This Method Is Faster

- No borrowing
- No writing
- One-step thinking
- Fewer mistakes

---

## Fast Addition Using Complements

Instead of adding directly, we round one number and adjust.

Example:
68 + 27

68 + 30 = 98  
98 − 3 = 95

Answer: 95

---

Example:
99 + 46

100 + 46 = 146  
146 − 1 = 145

Answer: 145

---

## Subtraction Without Borrowing (Advanced Example)

Example:
503 − 198

503 − 200 = 303  
303 + 2 = 305

Answer: 305

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Choosing wrong base
- Mixing complement and subtraction
- Overthinking simple problems
